Q13. Convert the following pseudocode to C++ code. Be sure to define the appropriate variables.
•	Store 20 in the speed variable.
•	Store 10 in the time variable.
•	Multiply speed by time and store the result in the distance variable.
•	Display the contents of the distance variable.
Ans:
// Assignment question 13.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int speed = 20;
	int time = 10;
	int distance = speed * time;
	cout << " Distance is " << distance << endl;
	return 0;
}

  


Q14. Convert the following pseudocode to C++ code. Be sure to define the appropriate variables.
•	Store 172.5 in the force variable.
•	Store 27.5 in the area variable.
•	Divide force by area and store the result in the pressure variable.
•	Display the contents of the pressure variable.
Ans: / Assignment question 14.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double force = 172.5;
	double area = 27.5;
	double pressure = force / area;
	cout << "Pressure is " << pressure << endl;
	return 0;
