Bug 1:
The incorrect original code or code snippit that you wrote:
average = total / 3;

What bug does the original code have?
average = total / n;
What misunderstanding of C++ concepts lead you to this incorrect code?
Misunderstading was the lack of concentration.
How to correct the bug?
just put n in place of 3.
The corresponding bug-free code or code snippet is:
average = total / n;

What is the take-away message from this bug?
Consentrate more on small small things.
Bug 2
The incorrect original code or code snippit that you wrote:
averageProgramming = totalProgramming / n;
code with bugs or code snippet with bug goes here
What bug does the original code have?
averageprogramming = totalprogramming / n;
What misunderstanding of C++ concepts lead you to this incorrect code?
I just declare the variable with small p but during programming i wrote P
How to correct the bug?
Put small p instead of capital P.

What is the take-away message from this bug?
Use the same spelling during declaration of variable during programming.
Bug 3
The incorrect original code or code snippit that you wrote:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
code with bugs or code snippet with bug goes here
What bug does the original code have?
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
What misunderstanding of C++ concepts lead you to this incorrect code?
Misunderstanding about the program using strings.So i have to write #include <string> during programming the string program.
How to correct the bug?
Put #include <string> on the top of the program.
The corresponding bug-free code or code snippet is:

b#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;
int main()

What is the take-away message from this bug?
Practice more string programs.
