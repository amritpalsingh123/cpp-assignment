Mistakes in question 13
// Assignment question 13.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int speed = 20;
	int time = 10;
	int distance = speed * time;
	cout <<  Distance is  << distance << endl;
	return 0;

So the mistake was I forgot to put Distance is in "" so i corrected it
The correction is:
cout <<  "Distance is" << distance << endl;

Mistakes in question 14
// Assignment question 14.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	double force = 172.5;
	double area = 27.5;
	double pressure = force / area;
	cout << "Pressure is " << pressure << endl;
	return 0;

}
I forgot to include using namespace std; next to the first line
so i corrected it
// Assignment question 14.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	double force = 172.5;
	double area = 27.5;
	double pressure = force / area;
	cout << "Pressure is " << pressure << endl;
	return 0;

}
